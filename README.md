# Opentelemetry-Project-Terraform-Infrastructure
This Project contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment, and this repository has the "Infrastructure as Code" for the EKS-Cluster with VPC with S3 used for remote backend and DynamoDB for state locking with modularity.
